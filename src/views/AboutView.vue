			<p class="lead">Hi there! Welcome to my corner of the internet!</p>
			<p>
				In all honesty, I'm not really sure what I should write here. But yeah, about me, I'm a
				student from Indonesia, and I'm currently studying Chemical & Biological Engineering in UBC
				Vancouver. My main interests is in biotechnology & bioinformatics, especially with plant
				biotechnology. As of lately, I'm also interested in the use of computer simulation in
				biotech.
			</p>
			<p>
				Other than that, I'm a big fan of linux and I love tinkering with anything I can get my
				hands on. I'm currently learning about Vue JS and web development (which is why I made this
				website), because it's the summer and I don't really have anything better to do
				unfortunately.
			</p>
			<p>So yeah, nice to meet you, and I hope you have a good time going through my website :D</p>
